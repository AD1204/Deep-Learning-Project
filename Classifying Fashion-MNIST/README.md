Classifying Fashion-MNIST --
Fashion-MNIST dataset, a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset. MNIST is actually quite trivial with neural networks where you can easily achieve better than 97% accuracy. Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes. It's more complex than MNIST, so it's a better representation of the actual performance of your network, and a better representation of datasets I will use in the real world.
